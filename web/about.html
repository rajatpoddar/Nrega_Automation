            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>NREGA Bot was created with a simple but powerful mission: to empower NREGA data entry operators and administrative staff by automating their most repetitive, time-consuming tasks. We understand that the work you do is critical, but the process can often be tedious. Our goal is to provide a reliable, secure, and user-friendly tool that saves you countless hours, reduces manual errors, and allows you to focus on more important aspects of your work.</p>

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>This project is developed and maintained by me, <strong>Rajat Poddar</strong>. As a software developer with a deep appreciation for the impact of the NREGA scheme, I saw an opportunity to apply my technical skills to solve a real-world problem faced by operators every day. This app is a passion project born from the desire to make a tangible difference in the efficiency and productivity of public service administration.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
            <p>We are committed to maintaining your privacy and security above all else. The application is designed to work locally on your computer, ensuring that none of your sensitive NREGA data ever leaves your machine. We believe in transparency and are dedicated to providing a tool that is not only powerful but also trustworthy.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your interest and support. It's what keeps this project growing and improving.</p>
