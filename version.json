    "2.7.9": [
      "✨ **New Feature (Reports): Issued MR Details** - Added a new automation to fetch the 'MGNREGS daily status as per e-muster issued' report. It drills down into the 'No. Of Ongoing Works' for a specific panchayat and extracts all work codes.",
      "✨ **New Feature (Utility): PDF Merger** - Added a new standalone utility tab to merge multiple PDF files into a single document.",
      "🚀 **Enhancement (Workflow):** Added a new workflow. After running FTO Generation, a 'Check Pending ABPS Labour' button appears, directing you to the MR Tracking tab, pre-configured to find ABPS pendency.",
      "🚀 **Enhancement (Workflow):** You can now send workcodes and the panchayat name directly from the new 'Issued MR Details' report to the 'Duplicate MR Print' tab.",
      "🚀 **Enhancement (MR Tracking):** The MR Tracking automation is now more intelligent. It can identify and report on specific laborers pending for ABPS by drilling down into wagelist details.",
      "🚀 **Enhancement (Duplicate MR):** Added a 'Merge Saved PDFs' button in the 'Results' tab. This allows merging all PDFs saved during the automation run into a single, combined PDF file.",
